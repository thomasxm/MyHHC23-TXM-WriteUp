**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective5.zip](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Use Azure Data Explorer to uncover misdeeds in Santa's IT enterprise. Go to Film Noir Island and talk to Tangle Coalbox for more information.

??? quote "Tangle Coalbox (Gumshoe Alley PI Office)"
    Greetings, rookie. Tangle Coalbox of Kusto Detective Agency here.<br/>

    I've got a network infection case on Film Noir Island that needs your expertise.<br/>

    Seems like someone clicked a phishing link within a client's organization, and trouble's brewing.<br/>

    I'm swamped with cases, so I need an extra pair of hands. You up for the challenge?<br/>

    You'll be utilizing the Azure Data Explorer and those KQL skills of yours to <br/>investigate this incident.<br/>

    Before you start, you'll need to create a free cluster.<br/>

    Keep your eyes peeled for suspicious activity, IP addresses, and patterns that'll help us crack this case wide open.<br/>

    Remember, kid, time is of the essence. The sooner we can resolve this issue, the better.<br/>

    If you run into any problems, just give me a holler, I've got your back.<br/>

    Good hunting, and let's bring this cyber criminal to justice.<br/>

    Once you've got the intel we need, report back and we'll plan our next move. Stay sharp, rookie.<br/>
  

## Hints

    Well, that's not good. It looks like Alabaster clicked on the link and downloaded a suspicious file. I don't know exactly what giftwrap.exe does, but it seems bad.

    Can you take a closer look at endpoint data from Alabaster's machine? We need to figure out exactly what happened here. Word of this hack is starting to spread to the other elves, so work quickly and quietly!

#### Case 5: 

??? quote "Lieutenant Hackstopper"

    Wow, you're unstoppable! Great work finding the malicious activity on Alabaster's machine. I've been looking a bit myself and... I'm stuck. The messages seem to be garbled. Do you think you can try to decode them and find out what's happening?

    Look around for encoded commands. Use your skills to decode them and find the true meaning of the attacker's intent! Some of these might be extra tricky and require extra steps to fully decode! Good luck!

    If you need some extra help with base64 encoding and decoding, click on the 'Train me for this case' button at the top-right of your screen. 


### Question 5

!!! question "Question" 

    1. When was the attacker's first base64 encoded PowerShell command executed on Alabaster's machine?

    2. What was the name of the file the attacker copied from the fileshare? (This might require some additional decoding)

    3. The attacker has likely exfiltrated data from the file share. What domain name was the data exfiltrated to?

    Congratulations, you've cracked the Kusto detective agency section of the Holiday Hack Challenge! <br/>

    By now, you've likely pieced together the broader narrative of the alert we <br/>received. It all started with Wombley Cube, a skilled Craftsperson, and a <br/>malicious insider, who sent an email to the esteemed head elf, Alabaster <br/>Snowball. This seemingly innocent email contained a dangerous link leading to <br/>the malicious domain, MadElvesNorthPole.org. Alabaster Snowball, from his PC, unwittingly clicked on the link, resulting in the download and execution of <br/>malicious payloads. Notably, you've also discerned Wombley Cube's ulterior <br/>motive: to pilfer a copy of Santa's naughty or nice list and erase the data <br/>on the share drive containing critical information to Santa's operations. Kudos to you!<br/>
