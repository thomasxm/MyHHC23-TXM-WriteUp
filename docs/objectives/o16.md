## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Over on Steampunk Island, Bow Ninecandle is having trouble opening a padlock. Do some research and see if you can help open it!

??? quote "Bow Ninecandle"
    Hey there! I'm Bow Ninecandle, and I've got a bit of a... 'pressing' situation.<br/>

    You see, I need to get into the lavatory, but here's the twist: it's secured with a combination padlock.<br/>

    Talk about bad timing, right? I could really use your help to figure this out before things get... well, urgent.<br/>

    I'm sure there are some clever tricks and tips floating around the web that can help us crack this code without too much of a flush... I mean fuss.<br/>

    Remember, we're aiming for quick and easy solutions here - nothing too complex.<br/>

    Once we've gathered a few possible combinations, let's team up and try them out.<br/>

    I'm crossing my legs - I mean fingers - hoping we can unlock this door soon.<br/>

    After all, everyone knows that the key to holiday happiness is an accessible lavatory!<br/>

    Let's dive into this challenge and hopefully, we won't have to 'hold it' for too long! Ready to help me out?<br/>

## Solution

Your need to watch this video on the lock:

```

When you input the three possible digits, make sure after you stop at the 1st digit, you turn counter clockwise and PASS your 1st digit. Then land on your 2nd digit, and to the 3rd digit by turning clockwise again. This means if your 1st digit is larger than your 2nd, you may pass your 2nd digit twice. 


#### Step 1 (Identifying the Sticky Number)

To determine the sticky number, partially apply tension to the lock and rotate it to locate the point where resistance is felt.

The lock showed resistance at 25, hence we'll remember this as our sticky number. It's important to note that the tension indicator was a shade of brown/dark orange, not full red. Full red signifies maximum tension, preventing the lock from rotating.

Record the sticky number for future reference:

Sticky Number = 30

#### Step 2 (Determining Guess Numbers)

We need to find guess numbers between 0 and 11 where the lock freely moves. This involves observing the lock's movement at fractional positions between whole numbers, not at the whole numbers themselves.

For clarity, here's an example.

Set the dial at 0.5, then apply maximum tension and observe the lock's reaction.

Since the lock alternates between 0 and 1, we conclude these aren't our guess numbers.

Notice how the lock alternates between 3.5 and 4.5, passing over the number 4, which becomes our initial guess number.

Similarly, as the lock moves between 4.5 and 5.5, we deduce that 5 is our second guess number. Let's record these:

Guess Values:
1st = 4
2nd = 5

#### Step 3 (Determining the First Digit of the Combination)

Figuring out the first digit is straightforward, as these types of locks generally follow the same rule. We simply add 5 to the sticky number identified in step 1.

Sticky Number = 30
1st Digit of Combo = 30 + 5 = 35

#### Step 4 (Identifying the Third Digit)

This step involves deducing potential values for the third digit, a common procedure across locks of this type.

We'll use our first combination number and the two guess numbers from step 2.

First, calculate the remainder value, which aids in pinpointing the third digit.

1st value = 35

Divide this value by 4 to determine the remainder:

35 / 4 = 8 with a remainder of 3

Next, arrange our guess numbers in a table and increment each by 10 three times:

4 14 24 34
5 15 25 35

These are potential lock combinations. To narrow them down, divide each by 4 and match the remainders with that of our first combination value. We're looking for numbers in the table with the same remainder as our first value.

[0,2,0,2]

[1,3,1,3]


From this, we identify 15 and 35 as potential third digits, both sharing the remainder value of 3.

Current combination status:

1st value = 35
2nd Value = ??
3rd Value = Either 15 or 35

#### Step 5 (Determining the More Accurate Third Value)

For both 15 and 35, apply significant tension to the lock and observe which number offers more slack, indicating the likely third value.

15 is noticeably looser than 35, suggesting it's the correct third value.

#### Step 6 (Calculating the 2nd Digit)

Now, we'll create tables like in step 4 to narrow down the second digit. This step leads to eight possible values, requiring some trial and error.

Starting with our earlier remainder of 3:

remainder = 3
Add 2 to it for the first table row, then increase the result by 8 four times:

5 13 21 29 37

For the second row, add 6 to the remainder to get the first value:

9 17 25 33 41
(Note: 41 represents 1 on the lock)

Displaying both rows together:

5 13 21 29 37
9 17 25 33 41

Eliminate values within two digits of our third value (15). Thus, remove 13 and 17 as they are too close to 18 (within 2 digit distance).

Step 7 (Unlocking the Lock)

Combination values so far:

1st: 35
2nd: Either 5, 21, 29, 37, 9, 25, 33, 41(1)
3rd: 15

As mentioned, this stage involves trying each combination variant (eight in total).

Start by turning clockwise to the first value, then rotate counter-clockwise past the 1st value and reach the second by align it, followed by aligning the third value by turning clockwise.

Observe the process as the combinations are tested.

The lock opens, revealing the correct combination:

35 - 37 - 15
