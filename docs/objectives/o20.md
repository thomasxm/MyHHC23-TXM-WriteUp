# Space Island Door Access Speaker

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    There's a door that needs opening on Space Island! Talk to Jewel Loggins there for more information.

??? quote "Jewel Loggins (Spaceport Point)"
    What are you doing here, and who are you?<br/>

    Me first? I'm Jewel Loggins. And I was trekking through the jungle and happened to find this place.<br/>

    I liked this spot and decided to set up camp. Seeing you here is quite the surprise.<br/>

    Well, because the only other person I've ever seen come here is Wombley Cube.<br/>

    I thought this tram station in the middle of the jungle was strange to begin with, but then Wombley added to the intrigue.<br/>

    I guess all this spy stuff is typical for him, so maybe I shouldn't think much of it. I'm sure everything's fine.<br/>

    Every time he comes here, he says something to the speaker. Then, the door opens, and he rides the tram somewhere.<br/>

    I gave it a try, but the door didn't open for me. Knowing Wombley, it's some kind of secret passphrase.<br/>

    If you wanna see where the tram goes, I think you need to find out what that passphrase is.<br/>

    Ribb Bonbowford over at Coggoggle Marina on Steampunk Island works with Wombley. Try asking if he knows.<br/>

    I hope you find it. I'll be here when you get back!<br/>

    What, you know the passphrase!? Let me try it!<br/>

    Nope, didn't work. Knowing Wombley, the passphrase isn't the only requirement. He's all about that MFA!<br/>

    Oh yeah, multi-factor authentication! The passphrase for something he knows, and his voice for something he is!<br/>

    That's it! You need to be Wombley. You need his voice. Now, how are you gonna get that?<br/>

    Since only us elves can get a subscription to use ChatNPT, try searching for another AI tool that can simulate voices. I'm sure there's one out there.<br/>


## Hints

??? tip "MFA: Something You Are"
    It seems the Access Speaker is programmed to only accept Wombley's voice. Maybe you could get a sample of his voice and use an AI tool to simulate Wombley speaking the passphrase. 

??? tip "MFA: Something You Know"
    Wombley says a specific phrase into the Access Speaker. He works in the Research Department and everything they do it super secret, so it may be a challenge to find out what the phrase is. Ribb also works in that department. Try to find and ask him.

## Solution

The audio sample wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3 can be download from: 
```
https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2023/wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3.zip
```
You can get the link by speak to Wombley Cube at Noir island - Chiaroscuro City. 

We need to complete the Active Directory challenge to get the secret passphrease. 

Now we have “something Wombley knows” and “something Wombleyhas”. 

A free voice cloning can do the job:

Just download the fake voice MP3 and played it to the door. 

Pretty scary how easy we can fake other people’s voice.

!!! success "Answer"
    Wombley says: <br/>
    And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;<br/>
    So through the valley and over the height.'<br/>
    And he'll silently take his way.<br/>


## Response

!!! quote "Jewel Loggins"
    Are you like a master spy or something?<br/>
    I've only seen stuff like that in the movies!<br/>

    It sure is scary what you can do with AI, huh? <br/>
    I sure hope ChatNPT has better guardrails in place. <br/>
