## Introduction

Welcome to my SANS Holiday Hack 2023 write-up. This is the first time I have played [KringleCon](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge-2023). I am very delighted to have completed the Holiday Hack Challenge just two days before Christmas Eve. Now you can sit back and enjoy the storyline of this holiday season and save Christmas from the baddies. 

The challenges have been divided into six islands. Most of the challenges you can complete on your own. For some challenges, there is a prerequisite. For example, in order to complete the Camera Access, you would need to complete Active Directory and Certificate SSHenanigans first. If you talk to every single elf on each island, you will gather all the hints you need and have objectives unlocked. Remember to talk to the elf who issued you the objective after you complete it. They may give you guidance on the follow-up challenges. Besides the main challenges, there are two bonus challenges: fishing and boat racing [Easter eggs](./easter_eggs.md). You also want to keep your eyes out for the three game boy cartridges spread along 3 islands! 

In some challenges (Camera Access, Fishing Mastery), I have provided custom scripts to automate the process. These scripts were generated using precise AI prompts. However, you should always validate the codes AI provides, as I have more than once found that AI can give incorrect parameters, akin to a minefield. If I execute them without reviewing and correcting the code, I would end up not achieving the desired results. 

The first objective "Holiday Hack Orientation" you can complete it by talk to "Jingle Ringford" on Christmas Island and get your bearings at Geese Islands. 


!!! note "100-page submission limit"
    Each year there's a huge number of write-ups that need to be reviewed by the Counter Hack team. To find a good middle ground between preventing information overload and creating a write-up that can stand on its own as a learning resource, some parts, like the *navigation tip* below, are collapsed by default. Skipping over these will not take away from understanding the overall solution, but feel free to expand them to get some additional information.

??? tip "Navigation tip"
    Even with less than 100 pages, there's still quite a bit of information to read through. To make things a little easier, you can use ++"P"++ or ++","++ to go to the previous section, ++"N"++ or ++"."++ to navigate to the next section, and ++"S"++, ++"F"++, or ++"/"++ to open up the search dialog.

    **TL;DR** if you keep pressing ++"N"++ or ++"."++ from this point forward, you'll hit all the content in the right order! :smile:

## Response

??? quote "Santa"
    You've done it! You've saved me and my sleigh from Jack Frost's dastardly plan!<br/>

    I must admit, it's astonishing the lengths Jack will go to in order to try and stop the holiday season.<br/>
     
    Even after being banished from Earth, he managed to create an AI to social engineer us into moving our holiday operations to the Geese Islands, putting us right in the path of his satellite. <br/>

    And to think he even recruited one of my dear elves... I never saw that coming. Oh, Wombley...<br/>

    But thanks to your incredible efforts, we've proof that Jack violated his parole, and the chances of him interfering with the holidays ever again are all but impossible! <br/>

    I can't thank you enough for your help in protecting the magic and joy of this special time of year.<br/>

    I have prepared you some special swags only for winner. You can claim them from this [shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) <br/>

    I'd like to wish you a most wonderful holiday season, no matter where you may be on Earth or what the weather is like. <br/>

    Keep that holiday spirit alive, my friend, and remember: a little change now and then can lead to something magical!<br/>

    Ho ho ho, happy holidays! <br/>


??? quote "Jack Frost"

    Okay, listen up, yes I've been caught, but let me tell you, my plan was incredible, I mean really incredible.<br/>

    I and the trolls created ChatNPT, a fantastic AI, and left it behind in the North Pole in 2021 to trick Santa into moving to the Geese Islands. It worked like a charm, perfectly perfect.<br/>

    My satellite was geostationary, right over the islands to maintain comms with ChatNPT, and Wombley in the gound station. It was genius. Absolute genius, really.<br/>

    I was reviewing all the prompts as they were sent, and changing the responses in real time thanks to Santa's operation moving to the Geese Islands. This was very smart. Very, very, very smart, very efficient.<br/>

    And Wombley, the elf, joining me? Easy. He was so easy to convince.<br/>

    You see, there's a big, big dissent in Santa's ranks, huge.<br/>

    The elves, they're not happy with Santa.<br/>

    Mark my words, even if I don't stop Santa, his own elves will.<br/>

    It's going to be tremendous, this you will see.<br/>


## Conclusion
Now you have saved Christmas from the "bad guy"'s evil plan, enjoy the holiday!
!!! Abstract "Narrative"
    Just sit right back and you’ll hear a tale, <br/>
    A tale of a yuletide trip <br/>
    That started from a tropic port, <br/>
    Aboard this tiny ship <br/>
    Santa and his helpful elves <br/>
    To Geese Islands did go <br/>
    Continuing their merry work <br/>
    O'er sand instead of snow <br/>
    New this year: a shiny tool <br/>
    The elves logged in with glee <br/>
    What makes short work of many tasks? <br/>
    It's ChatNPT. It's ChatNPT <br/>
    From images to APIs <br/>
    This AI made elves glad <br/>
    But motivations were unknown <br/>
    So was it good or bad? <br/>
    Could it be that NPT <br/>
    Was not from off-the-shelf? <br/>
    Though we'll forgive and trust again <br/>
    We'd found a naughty elf <br/>
    This fancy AI tool of ours <br/>
    With all our work remained <br/>
    Not good or bad, our online friend <br/>
    Just did as it was trained <br/>
    Surely someone's taint must be <br/>
    Upon our AI crutch <br/>
    Yes indeed, this bold new world <br/>
    Bore Jack Frost's icy touch<br/>
    Though all's returned to steady state<br/>
    There's one thing that we know<br/>
    We'll all be needed once again.
