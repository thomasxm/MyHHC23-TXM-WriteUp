# Game Cartridges Vol 3

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective5.zip](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Find the third Gamegosling cartridge and beat the game

??? quote "Angel Candysalt (Rusty Quay)"
    The name's Angel Candysalt, the great treasure hunter!<br/>

    A euphemism? No, why do people always ask me that??<br/>

    Anyways, I came here to nab the treasure hidden in this ship graveyard, only to discover it's protected by this rusted maze.<br/>

    That must be why all these old ships are here. Their crew came to find the <br/>treasure, only to get lost in the labrynth.<br/>

    There are 3 buried treasures in total, each in its own uncharted area around Geese Islands.<br/>

    I've been getting lost in this maze for hours now with no luck, and my feet are starting to get sore.<br/>

    Maybe you'll be able to find the way through. Here, use my Gameboy Cartridge <br/>Detector. Go into your items and test it to make sure it's still working.<br/>

    When you get close to the treasure, it'll start sounding off. The closer you get, the louder the sound.<br/>

    No need to activate or fiddle with it. It just works!<br/>

    At least it's obvious where this one is. See that shiny spot over to the right? That's gotta be where it is! If only I had a bird's eye view.<br/>

    But how to get there? Up? Down? Left? Right? Oh well, that's your problem now!<br/>

    Come back if you can find your way to it, and I'll tell you some secrets I've heard about this one.<br/>
    You can use `<br/>` to ensure each sentence starts on a new line.

## Hints

??? tip "Bird's Eye View"
    The location of the treasure in Rusty Quay is marked by a shiny spot on the ground. To help with navigating the maze, try zooming out and changing the camera angle.

??? tip "Gameboy 3"
    1) This one is a bit long, it never hurts to save your progress! 2) 8bit systems have much smaller registers than you’re used to. 3) Isn’t this great?!? The coins are OVERFLOWing in their abundance.

## Solution

You can find the cartridge at:

Two ways to go about this challenge. 

First we can pay attention to the NPC’s dialogues. We collect 399 coins and jump to the right place to win. There is a cheat to this game which we can use backspace (delete) key to rewind the time. It will give us room for errors and re-do the jumping. The second way to win is to use a debugger (BGB, Gihdra) to change the hex and “change” our coin balance to 999 without overflow. The 0XFE = 254 in decimal.

    The life of a treasure hunter isn't easy, but it sure is exciting!

    Oh it's a video game, I love video games! But you've claimed this treasure, nicely done.

    Now, about those secrets I've been told. They're pretty cryptic, but they are. Hopefully that helps with something!

    You have all three? Wow, you must be the greatest treasure hunter that ever lived!
