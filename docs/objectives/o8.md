    Arrr, matey, shiver me timbers! There be buried treasure herrrrre.<br/>

    Just kidding, I'm not really a pirate, I was just hoping it would make finding the<br/> treasure easier.<br/>

    I guess you heard about the fabled buried treasure, too? I didn't expect to see <br/>anyone else here. This uncharted islet was hard to find.<br/>

    I bet one of these creepy toys has the treasure, and I'm sure not going anywhere<br/> near them!<br/>

    If you find the treasure, come back and show me, and I'll tell you what I was able<br/> to research about it.<br/>

    Good luck!<br/>

Tom Liston is a miner

Try sing to the block to the south of Kodyâ€™s position. 
You can reset the blocks with kody. If you feel like you don't want to hack it but 
actually play this one. You can sing to the block. Once you singe to the correct block, it will flash, you need to push it the the place where it supposed to be. For 
one particular, you need to "think outside of the box". The aim is to fix the QR code, so that you can scan it!!
