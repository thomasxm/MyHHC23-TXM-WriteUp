??? quote "Noel Boetie"

## Hints

??? tip "Insert Hint 1 Title"
    Along the way you will receive different hints. Insert them here.

??? tip "Insert Hint 2 Title"
    Along the way you will receive different hints. Insert them here.

## Solution

ChatGPT prompt: Identify any errors or inconsistencies in the penetration test findings report, and explain why and how. The trick to using AI to find errors here is to feed it short paragraphs. ChatGPT tends to be less effective when given a large chunk of data.

No.3: By intercepting HTTP request traffic on 88555/TCP, malicious actors can exploit this vulnerability by crafting and submitting specially serialized objects that can lead to remote code execution upon deserialization.
The maximum port number is: 65536

No.6: HTTP SEND (should be POST? )

No.9: When given an HTTP 7.4.33 (wrong, HTTP 1.0, 1.1 or 2) request


### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
