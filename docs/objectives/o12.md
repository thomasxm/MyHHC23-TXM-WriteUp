**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective5.zip](https://.../)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Fitzy Shortstack on Film Noir Island needs help battling dastardly phishers. Help sort the good from the bad!

??? quote "Fitzy Shortstack"
    Just my luck, I thought...<br/>

    A cybersecurity incident right in the middle of this stakeout.<br/>

    Seems we have a flood of unusual emails coming in through ChatNPT.<br/>

    Got a nagging suspicion it isn't catching all the fishy ones.<br/>

    You're our phishing specialist right? Could use your expertise in looking through the output of ChatNPT.<br/>

    Not suggesting a full-blown forensic analysis, just mark the ones screaming <br/>digital fraud.<br/>

    We're looking at all this raw data, but sometimes, it takes a keen human eye to <br/>separate the chaff, doesn't it?<br/>

    I need to get more powdered sugar for my donuts, so do ping me when you have <br/>something concrete on this.<br/>


## Hints

??? tip "DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, oh my!"
